// the zip (tools/emoji-font.mjs); a 13312-byte build can afford neither the
// font nor a fraction of it, so this is the same artwork fetched at runtime for
// the cost of the rule that names it.
//
// THE TRADE, said plainly because it is not free: the page stops being
// self-contained. Every other byte of this game is inside the zip, and this is
// a reference OUT of it — offline the rule simply does not resolve and the
// emoji fall back to the platform's own, which is exactly what shipped before,
// so the failure mode is the old behaviour rather than a broken page. Worth
// knowing that most size-limited competitions require an entry to run with no
// network at all; under those rules this rule is the one thing to take out.
//
// WHICH IS WHY IT IS NO LONGER IN THE SHEET AT BUILD TIME. This is handed to
// src/css.ts as __EMOJI__, and nothing appends it until the player asks for it
// from the title menu — so an entry judged with the network off never reaches
// for the URL at all, and one played with the network on gets the artwork on
// the first press and on every run after it.
//
// Protocol-relative so the page works from file:// as well as over https.
// THIS PROJECT'S OWN Pages path, and deliberately not the shortest one that
// works. Every character of the URL is in the payload, so the user site — the
// repo literally named joseprio.github.io — was measured at //joseprio.github
// .io/e.ttf and is worth about 8 B: the /color-alchemy/ prefix is fixed by
// this repo's name, and `e.ttf` shaves the filename too. It was taken and
// then GIVEN BACK once the help line freed 93 B, because those 8 B cost the
// publish flow a whole second repository: `npm run emoji-publish` stages the
// file here and you commit it here, which is one step, and the tool's own
// header is a warning about how easily that one step is already forgotten.
// If the budget ever needs 8 B badly enough, the short URL is live and works
// (both paths serve the same file today) — but read emoji-publish.mjs first.
// Written by hand and never run through cssnano, for the reason the director's
// font rules skip it too: nothing should get to rewrite a src url on the way
// through.
// NOT in src/style.css, because that file is shared with the cut, and the cut
// has a real font of its own to name.
// Only the @font-face: the family is NAMED in style.css's own body shorthand
// (`font: 14px/1.45 e, monospace`), which is 3 characters there against 29 for
// a `body{font-family:e,monospace}` rule appended here. The name is inert in
// the builds that do not define it, and it is ONE LETTER because it is written
// twice — here and there — and never read by anything but the CSS engine.
//
// NO unicode-range, and that is a claim about the FONT: style.css leads with
// this family so the colour artwork beats whatever emoji coverage the platform
// monospace has, which is only safe while the face answers for nothing but
// emoji. It did not, for a while — nanoemoji gives every font it builds a
// `space` glyph, so U+0020 was in the cmap and every space in the UI came back
// at the emoji advance, 17px against monospace's 7.69px. The fix is in

// emitted strings change. Measured worth 161 B packed.
//
// Three things about the encoding were measured rather than assumed, and each
// went the opposite way to the obvious guess:
//
//  1. TABLE-INDEX ORDER, NOT FREQUENCY ORDER. Giving the most-referenced ids
//     the lowest codes measured 7 B WORSE. The table is deliberately ordered so
//     a recipe's ingredient is defined a line or two above it, so index order
//     puts related codes next to each other and roadroller's sparse models
//     predict that; frequency order scrambles exactly that locality.
//  2. UNIFORM TWO CHARACTERS, NEVER ONE. A variable-length scheme (one char for
//     the first 88 ids, two for the rest) removes 500 MORE characters and costs
//     65 B MORE. Fixed alignment is what the context models want.
//  3. THE PAIRS STAY NESTED. Running the codes together into one string per

//     half as much, which is the same finding the table's own header records
//     for flattening, reproduced with a different alphabet.

// before terser lets join_vars merge declarations it otherwise cannot (join_vars
// only merges ADJACENT declarations OF THE SAME KIND). Safe as a text pass here:
// every `const` in the chunk is a real declaration — checked, none inside a string
// literal — and dropping immutability cannot change behaviour in code that never
// reassigns, which is exactly what `const` was asserting.

// commented gradient stacks in src/elements.ts stay readable, and the byte is
// taken here. `transparent` says what it means; `#0000` does not.
//
// SAFE AS A TEXT PASS because every occurrence in this chunk is inside a string
// literal — the stylesheet, and the `bg:`/`s:` values in the element table.
// `transparent` is not a JS keyword and nothing in src/*.ts uses it as an
// identifier, checked. The count is logged and the pass throws if it ever finds
// none, which is what a rename or a refactor that moved the CSS would look like.

// Cheap in raw characters and NOT cheap in packed bytes, which is the lesson
// this project keeps relearning: 318 characters leave the chunk and 11 bytes
