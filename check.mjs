   completing, and the failure told you nothing about which pair had moved.
   For a table that is edited as often as this one, that is a bad trade, so
   the paths are DERIVED now, from the same RECIPE map every other check
   reads. The assertions kept below are the ones that are actually about
   behaviour: that a leaner run lowers the stored best and a sloppier one does
   not. The absolute move counts are whatever the current tree happens to

// a route through an element that is not solved yet simply does not count.
//
// RELAXATION, NOT RECURSION, and the difference is not style. This was a
// memoised depth-first walk that cached only the sets it found: an element
// whose every route was cyclic resolved to null, null is falsy, so the cache
// missed and the whole subtree below it was re-explored on the next visit. It
// survived a tree where the cyclic elements were deep and rare. It stopped
// surviving one where Black sits three steps from the start and carries four
// routes back through the materials: the walk blew past three MILLION calls in
// 139ms and never returned. Relaxing to a fixed point is cycle-safe by
// construction — a cycle is simply a set that never improves anyone — and it
// finishes in a handful of passes over 300 elements.
// FIRST SOLUTION WINS, and that is what keeps the answer ORDERABLE. A closure
// is only ever built out of closures that are already settled, and it is never
// revised afterwards — so the order elements get settled in IS a legal play
// order, and no set can quietly come to depend on the element it is for.
// Revising for a smaller set is what breaks that: Magic can be reached through
// the Crystal Ball, the Crystal Ball through Magic, and a pass that takes the
// smaller of the two happily settles on a pair that cannot be played in either
// direction. It cost a run of `unorderable: magic` to find, which is the good
// failure — the harness refusing to hand out a move order it cannot walk.
// What is given up is a little minimality; the file already says the absolute
// move counts are reported rather than asserted, and every assertion here is
// about one run being leaner than another, which a superset relation preserves.

// animation is remove-class, flush, add-class; without the flush the browser
// coalesces the pair into no change within one turn and nothing starts. That
// flush was a bare `void cd.offsetWidth`, and closure ADVANCED deleted it as a
// pure read whose value goes nowhere — so two dead ends in a row shook once.
// Counts animationstart events rather than the class, which is present either
// way; only the event says the animation actually ran. Own board, own reset:
// this spends moves and nothing after it should care.

// --- the hint answers the quest while there is one ------------------------
// Last, because it spends moves freely and every move-count assertion is behind
// it. A fresh run taken 22 moves in: deep enough that the off-path branches (the
// animals, the drinks, the ornaments) are reachable, which is the whole point —
// at a six-element board EVERY reachable element is on the quest path and this
// check would pass with the priority switched off.
//
// Five hints, each bought and then MADE so the next one is a fresh answer rather
// than the standing one. With the priority on, every one is an ancestor of the
// Rainbow or the Unicorn. With it off, each has roughly a one-in-three chance of
// wandering — the failure this catches is a regression, and it catches it most
// runs rather than every run. The counts go in the label so a reader can see how
// strong the sample actually was.
//
// Only hints taken with a quest-path pair ACTUALLY AVAILABLE are graded. The
// narrowing in game.ts is deliberately a filter and not a veto — "if nothing
// within reach is on the quest path the full list stands" — so a hint offered
// when the path is momentarily exhausted is behaving correctly by wandering, and
// grading it would fail the check for doing the documented thing. That state got
// common enough to fail real builds as the tree grew past 120 elements. Grading
// only the decidable turns keeps this a test of the PRIORITY rather than of how
// the quest target happened to land.
