// getElementById call, and the helper that wrapped it, buy nothing. This file
// is the TypeScript side of that: ambient declarations, no emitted code.
// closure-externs.js is the compiler's side, and must list the same names.
//
// TWO letters, never one: the roadroller decoder ships a handful of
// single-letter globals of its own (the build logs them), and a one-letter id
// would be shadowed by one — silently, and only in the packed build. Two
// letters cannot collide with them.
//
// The ids themselves live in src/index.html; #ob is built by openOverlay and
// only exists while the overlay is open.
