// The element tree. THERE IS NO n FIELD ANY MORE: the display name is DERIVED
// from the id, one capital per word, and the id carries whatever spacing or
// casing that takes — "teddy bear" -> "Teddy Bear", and "uFO" -> "UFO", which
// is one of the two acronyms ("iD" -> "ID" is the other) and the reason the
// derivation only ever touches a word's first letter. That is the whole trick: a written-out name is a NEAR-MISS
// repeat of a string roadroller has already seen, and a near miss costs real
// bits where an exact repeat costs almost none. Dropping the derivable ones was
// worth ~380 B packed; dropping the last nine, by spacing their ids, was worth
// a further 56 B measured. A space is safe everywhere an id goes — dataset
// values, the "a+b" RECIPE keys, and JSON in the one save entry — and n is
// filled in below, so every consumer still sees a plain string.
// c = colour swatch, bg = custom swatch background (any CSS background stack),
// e = emoji icon, s = inline SVG body on a 0 0 32 32 viewBox (rendered as an
// <svg class=s>, so it picks up the square swatches' size rules, and c still
// supplies the glow), r = recipes (unordered pairs of ids). Several recipes may
// make one element, and an alternate may be cyclic (Lava + Stone melts back
// into Lava) — that is flavour for a pair players try, never a cheaper route.
//
// THE PAIRS STAY NESTED, and this was measured rather than assumed. Flattening
// r to ["red","green","red","cyan", …] takes 835 chars out of the chunk and
// puts 195 B BACK ON the zip — 13134 -> 13329 with both fits redone, and
// 13200 -> 13387 with the reorder off on both sides, so it is not an artefact
// of a stale fn-order. The brackets are the cheapest bytes in this file to
// predict and they earn it twice over: "[" and "]," tell roadroller which HALF
// of a pair an id is, and flattened every separator is the same comma. Cheap
// punctuation that buys context is not the same as waste.
//
// BLACK AND THEN MATTER ARE THE THROAT OF THE TREE: Matter is still the sole
// route to Earth, Air and Water, and Matter is now White + Black, so nearly
// everything is unreachable until Black is found. Deliberate — know it before
// rewiring around it. Black keeps three independent ways in (the opposite
// pairs) so the gate is wider than the two Matter used to have.
//
// MAGIC AND THE CRYSTAL BALL ARE MUTUALLY CYCLIC: Magic + Glass makes the Ball,
// the Ball + a Rainbow makes Magic. It resolves only because BOTH ends keep a
// route that does not run through the other (Magic from Wood + Star and from
// Pumpkin + Night, the Ball from Violet + Glass). Measured: drop any one or two
// of those three and everything still resolves; drop ALL THREE and Magic, the
// Ball and the Unicorn go unreachable together. One independent way in,
// somewhere in the pair, is the invariant to preserve here.
//
// THE QUOTES ARE NOT HERE. A field on a live object is reachable, so closure
// could not drop strings a shipping build has no room for. They live in
// src/quotes.ts behind __DIRECTOR__, keyed by id and kept in this table's order.
