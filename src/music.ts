// Background music: "astral blur", the 24 kHz floatbeat in experiments/, ported
// to run in the page. galaxy-raid plays its bytebeats through a
// ScriptProcessorNode filling one sample at a time (src/app/music.ts); this does
// the same, only the source is a stereo float engine rather than a one-liner, so
// the node has two output channels and the samples go out as-is.
//
// The original is a general synth framework — ADSR envelopes, 2- and 4-operator
// FM voices, wave-shapers, filters, delays, a Householder/Hadamard reverb, a
// mixer and a sequencer — and the tune uses maybe a third of it. What survives
// here is only what this song reaches: three waveforms, one envelope shape, one
// random LFO, the 2-op voice (a plain oscillator is the same voice with the
// modulator turned off), gain, the low-pass, the multi-tap delay, the diffuser.
// Dropped: tri/sqr/sawtf waves, the 4-op voice, wave-shaping synths, mod_wav,
// env_const, mono/softclip/dcremove, the single-tap delay, and the high-pass and
// mono branches of the filter.
//
// Everything that was an object with named fields is an array here — envelopes,
// LFOs, notes, effects, mixer channels — indexed by the constants below. It is
// the same data in a form that costs no property names.
//
// Two quirks of the original are reproduced deliberately, because they are what
// it sounds like, not what it means:
//   - `filter` allocates its history with Array(2).fill(Array(3).fill(...)), so
//     all three history rows AND both channels are one shared array. The biquad
//     it looks like collapses to a one-pole per section, fed by both channels in
//     turn. Faithfully collapsed here (K/G below), not "fixed".
//   - `diff` builds a `flip` array of random signs and then multiplies by 1.
//     Dead code; dropped.
// Its two real bugs are dropped too: `m.target in ["freq", ...]` is always false
// (`in` tests keys of an array), so every modulator is additive — which is what
// this tune wants anyway, all of its LFOs target a modulator phase; and
// notefreq() ignores the second argument it is handed.
