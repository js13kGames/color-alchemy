// Builds the director's cut a COLRv1 emoji font from Noto's own source SVGs —
// exactly the 245 sequences this table shows, and nothing else.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. tools/fonts.mjs used to take nine of Google's ten CDN chunks
// of Noto Color Emoji, 1317 KB, because a unicode-range chunk was the smallest
// unit the CDN would sell and a real subset meant "a new toolchain in a project
// whose build is Node and nothing else". This is 237 KB of the same artwork.
//
// THE ROAD NOT TAKEN, and it is worth writing down because it looked certain.
// harfbuzzjs ships harfbuzz-subset.wasm — no Python, no native build — and
// subsetting Noto-COLRv1.ttf with it produces a 216 KB woff2 whose 245
// sequences all shape to one glyph. It renders NOTHING. That build of harfbuzz
// has no colour-table support: it drops COLR and CPAL (and CBDT/CBLC from the
// bitmap build, 10.18 MB -> 5 KB), leaving structurally valid glyphs with no
// paint. subset-font bundles the same harfbuzzjs and fails identically.
// Passing COLR through untouched cannot work either — the layer glyphs it
// references have no cmap entry, so they are dropped, and the glyph ids are
// remapped underneath it.
// The lesson is in the acceptance test below: SHAPING IS NOT RENDERING. The
// broken subset passed a shaping check. Only looking at pixels caught it.
//
// THE TOOLCHAIN IS PYTHON, which is the cost of doing this properly: nanoemoji
// is googlefonts' own tool and what noto-emoji itself is built with. It also
// needs ninja, which it drives the build through, and both land in pip's
// scripts directory — which is routinely NOT on PATH, and whose absence shows
// up as a bare `WinError 2` from deep inside a subprocess call. Both are
// located explicitly below rather than assumed.
//
// A MISSING TOOLCHAIN IS NOT FATAL. The cut still builds without Python: it
// falls back to the CDN chunks, loudly. What would be fatal is shipping a cut
// whose emoji are silently blank, which is why the shaping check throws.

// TAKE THE SPACE BACK OFF THE FONT, because a font that claims U+0020 cannot
// lead a font stack. nanoemoji gives every font it builds a `space` glyph and a
// cmap entry pointing at it — reasonable for a font meant to set text, wrong for
// a subset that exists to draw 265 pictures. style.css puts this family FIRST
// (the low emoji codepoints need it to beat the platform's monospace), so while
// U+0020 was in the cmap every space in the UI was set at the emoji advance:
// 17px against monospace's 7.69px at 14px. The hosted build read visibly airier
// than a local one, where the protocol-relative URL cannot load at all.
//
// NOT A RESUBSET. Harfbuzz cannot subset COLRv1 — that is the road not taken at
// the top of this file — and it does not need to here: what matters is the
// mapping, not the glyph. Pointing U+0020 at glyph 0 is how a cmap says "not
// covered", and a shaper that resolves a character to .notdef reports no
// coverage, so the browser falls through to the next family. Every table keeps
// its size, every other glyph id keeps its value, and COLR is never touched.
//
// nanoemoji puts the space in its own single-codepoint segment (format 4) and
// group (format 12), which is what makes this a two-byte and four-byte edit.
// If a future build folds it into a range this throws rather than guessing.
