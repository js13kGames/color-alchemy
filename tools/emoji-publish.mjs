// Puts the director's emoji subset where the SHIPPING build can be pointed at
// it, as ./emoji.woff2 in the repo root.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. The two builds get their emoji from opposite directions. The
// director's cut generates the subset at build time and bundles it, so it is
// always in step with src/elements.ts — add an element with a new emoji and the
// next build has the glyph. The shipping build cannot afford 250 KB of font in
// a 13 KB budget, so it names a hosted one instead, at a URL fixed in
// rollup.config.mjs:
//
//   @font-face{font-family:e;src:url(//joseprio.github.io/color-alchemy/emoji.woff2)}
//
// Nothing in the build writes that file. So every time the element table gains
// an emoji, the shipped game silently falls back to the player's own set for it
// — not broken, just not the artwork the rest of the board is drawn in — until
// somebody regenerates the subset and republishes it. This is that step, made
// one command instead of a hunt through a hash-named cache.
//
// PUBLISHED FROM THIS REPO, which is the point of using this project's Pages
// path rather than the shorter user-site one. The short URL was measured at
// about 8 B and given back: it put the served file in a second repository, and
// a two-repo publish step is one more place for the staleness this header
// warns about to creep in. rollup.config.mjs records that trade.
//
// THE NAME IS NOT A CHOICE. The @font-face above asks for `emoji.woff2` exactly;
// the file has to be served under that name for any of this to work. The build
// writes it as emoji-<hash>.woff2, where the hash is over the emoji set, so the
// source name changes whenever the table does and is found rather than assumed.
