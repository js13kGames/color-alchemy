// Webfonts for the DIRECTOR'S CUT. Two of them, for two different reasons, and

// budget is not a trade, and the shipped game is meant to look native on the
// platform it is played on anyway.
//
//   NOTO COLOR EMOJI  pins the element artwork, so the cut wears the same
//                     emoji on every machine instead of Apple's here and
//                     Segoe's there. experiments/emoji-fonts.html is where
//                     that choice was made: of the sets checked, Noto and
//                     Twemoji are the only two covering all 183.
//   IM FELL ENGLISH   sets ALCHEMY on the title screen. A 17th-century
//                     English book face, which is the century the word belongs
//                     to; COLOR keeps its own rainbow-gradient sans above it,
//                     so the two halves of the title stop being the same
//                     lettering at two sizes.
//
// BOTH ARE CACHED in .fonts/ (gitignored) and keyed by the filename Google

// name and a fresh download, an unchanged one never re-downloads, and a

// fallback, so a machine without Python still produces a working cut — five and
// a half times heavier, and identical on screen.
